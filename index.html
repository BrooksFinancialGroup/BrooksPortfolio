    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>Mr. Chris DePietro tasked us with researching tactical, strategic, and core/satellite investment strategies. We have conducted an in-depth review of historical performance, risk characteristics, and practical applications that further differentiate the strategies specific to FCMS by reviewing the FCMS SharePoint platform and consulting with Mr. Brian Zabora. We also evaluated the benefits and drawbacks regarding volatility, economic shifts, and investment behavior considering fees, turnover, and taxes.</p>

  <!-- Risk Evaluation -->
  <div class="page" id="risk-evaluation">
    <h2>Risk Evaluation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strategic Risks:</strong> One of the primary concerns is that asset exposure remains fixed, meaning that portfolios are guaranteed to participate in market downturns, regardless of their severity. The buy and hold nature of SAA ensures that investors stay fully invested in underperforming sectors during downturns. In 2025, this has become especially relevant as institutional investors begin to reduce their exposure to US markets due to mounting fiscal concerns, persistent inflationary pressures (US inflation will begin to rise noticeably from Q3 2025, exceeding 3% year-on-year and potentially peaking at 4% in Q2 2026), and shifting geopolitical pressures ( US-China tensions and the rise of regional economic blocs are causing supply chains to be redefined, diversified, and restructured.) An SAA framework, however, would keep investors anchored to underperforming U.S. assets unless rebalancing is done manually and deliberately.
This rigidity also leads to missed tactical opportunities. As capital shifts toward undervalued equities and high yield bonds, SAA portfolios may fail to capitalize on these trends because they are not designed to respond dynamically to emerging market signals. The lack of adaptability is further complicated by the current IR stance seen by central banks in response to stagnant inflation. While core fixed income has become widely accepted, especially over US equities, the inability to shift weight quickly within a strategic framework may limit performance or even increase risk in certain environments. 
Allocation drift is another common risk that is associated with SAA, where asset classes rearrange themselves overtime, causing unplanned asset allocation. This mainly affects strategic asset allocation as the strategy is a more passive one, not reacting to the market, and not constantly managing the portfolio. As markets change and the values of specific holdings fluctuate, the asset allocation within client portfolios may deviate from intended targets, resulting in over- or under-exposure to certain risks. Rebalancing is a method many advisors use to bring portfolios back in line, but this isn't a part of strategic asset allocation. A well-known instance where this occurred is the 2020 covid crash that saw numerous portfolios go from 60/40 to even 50/50 splits. 
Additionally, behavioral discipline is critical in SAA but is one of the largest pitfalls within the strategy. The phycological toll of staying during steep drawdowns can push relationships to abandon their long-term strategy at inopportune times. This has become more evident in 2025 as equity markets remain volatile, and recession fears persist. These turbulent cycles paired with an SAA plan have inherent stress and potential for failure.
Lastly, as inflation continues to rise and concerns about real purchasing power grows, saa portfolios may lack liquidity that relationships want. These asset classes are increasingly seen as important inflation hedges but integrating them meaningfully into a traditional SAA framework can be difficult without compromising its fixed structure.

      <li><strong>Tactical Risks:</strong>Some benefits of TAA is that it allows investors to take advantage of short-term market trends, which could benefit more than SAA because you can reap the rewards of short-term upturns. In addition, it provides flexibility in shifting market conditions. Managers can mitigate risk by reducing exposure to overvalued or high-risk assets during volatile periods. Can adjust for inflation, growth, or contraction better than other asset allocation strategies due to the active management.
Some drawbacks of TAA is that the frequent trading can result in transaction fees, tax consequences like short-term capital gains, and maybe higher management fees. TAA is also complex to manage, it requires constant research and decision making (not ideal for passive investors). Market timing is extremely difficult and unpredictable, meaning there is higher likelihood for poor decision making or mistiming trends which could lead to underperformance in comparison to SAA. In addition, TAA can be more subject to emotional bias due to its activity.

      <li><strong>Core/Satellite Risks:</strong>The C/S approach is designed to strike a balance between the stability of strategic and the growth of tactical by combining a broadly diversified core portfolio with smaller actively managed satellite positions aimed at generating alpha ( excess return of an investment relative to a benchmark index ) However, this strategy is not without risks, especially in todays day and age. Both the core and satellite components are exposed to general market risk, and while the core is typically composed of passive or lower volatility investment the satellite positions often carry higher risk and require active decision making. As global markets continue to alter to interest rates, geopolitical tensions, and sector specific dislocations the potential for volatility across broth components in amplified. 

A common risk within the C/S approach is investment selection and with that the possibility of overallocation to satellite assets. To chase performance or capture emerging trends- such as the rotation into foreign equities as posed by BlackRock  investors may overweight these more volatile positions.   This can skew the overall nitrogen risk profile of the portfolio especially if the satellite exposure begins to dominate. This issue is compounded then working with clients who have more conservative goals or low risk tolerances. Tools like nitrogen, while helpful, are not always exhaustive or precise in capturing nuanced risk profiles which increase the likelihood of mismatches between the strategy structure and the investors true risk capacity. 
Additionally, the operational demands of the Core-Satellite approach cannot be overlooked. It requires continuous oversight, thoughtful rebalancing, and frequent market research to ensure the satellite components are not only performing but are still aligned with the investor’s goals. This kind of active management is time-consuming and often unsuitable for firms or advisors without sufficient resources or infrastructure. Fortunately, Brooks Financial Group, backed by the active management expertise of FCMS, is well-positioned to support the Core-Satellite model. FCMS’s tactical agility and emphasis on informed decision-making help mitigate the complexity and oversight burden that typically challenge this approach. In this sense, while the strategy requires diligence and careful implementation, the right support structure—such as that provided by FCMS—can make it a powerful tool for managing both long-term growth and short-term opportunity in a volatile and rapidly evolving market.
 associated with a Core-Satellite investment strategy include market risk, investment selection risk, over-allocation to satellite positions, and the inherent complexity of managing the portfolio. Both core and satellite components are susceptible to market fluctuations, which can impact the overall performance of the portfolio.
Another challenge is accurately identifying the appropriate risk level for the relationship, especially given that tools like Nitrogen are not fully comprehensive. A common pitfall is over-investing in satellite positions, even when a client relationship is more conservative—this can unintentionally introduce higher risk exposure.
Ultimately, the Core-Satellite approach is a complex and time-intensive strategy that demands ongoing market analysis and active oversight. However, with FCMS supporting Brooks Financial Group, their active management mindset provides a strong foundation for effectively implementing this strategy within Brooks.
