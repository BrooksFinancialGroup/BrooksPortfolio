            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>
              	Mr. Chris DePietro tasked us with researching tactical, strategic, and core/satellite investment strategies. We have conducted an in-depth review of historical performance, risk characteristics, and practical applications that further differentiate the strategies specific to FCMS by reviewing the FCMS SharePoint platform and consulting with Mr. Brian Zabora. We also evaluated the benefits and drawbacks regarding volatility, economic shifts, and investment behavior considering fees, turnover, and taxes.

            <h2>Overview of Investment Strategies</h2>
            <h3>Tactical</h3>
            <p>Tactical Asset Allocation is a strategy that involves actively managing and making adjustments to a portfolioâ€™s asset basket, based on market conditions and economic trends, aiming to capitalize on shorter-term opportunities and generate income.</p>
            
            <h3>Strategic</h3>
            <p>Strategic Asset Allocation is a strategy that involves setting target allocations for different securities and periodically/passively manage and rebalance the portfolio to maintain those targets. The strategy is used to achieve long-term investment goals by managing risk and return based on an investors specific risk tolerance and goals.</p>
            
            <h3>Core/Satellite</h3>
            <p>Core/Satellite Asset Allocation is a strategy that involves balancing the stability of SAA and the growth potential of TAA by combining a broadly diversified core portfolio with smaller actively managed satellite positions aimed to generate high yield and profitability.</p>

            <h2>FCMS Portfolio Translation</h2>
            <h3>Freedom</h3>
            <p>		Freedom, unlike Liberty, houses multiple strategies, and occasionally incorporates both into a single portfolio. This is beneficial  for both the relationship and the advisor as it allows an array of options catering to the specific desires and risk of the relationship.</p>
